* Most recently we have been working on designing a tool to recognise Irish sign langauge (ISL) and print it to the screen in English

##SIFT detection
This project utilises libraries such as OpenCV, imshowtools, numpy and matplotlib to implement
* Scale-invarient Feature transform feature matching based on two images of the same subject
    * FLANN based feature matching
* Essential matrix estimation (RANSAC Based)
    * Eight point algorithm and normalisation
* Computing and drawing Epipoler lines
* Canny Edge Detection to redraw a image in the style of a sketch
* Display disparity betwwen given images 
* Compute and display a depth map of the subject
