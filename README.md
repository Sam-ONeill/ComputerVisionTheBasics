# Computer Vision The Basics
This repository is a collection of small computer vision projects and is the collaborative work of Sam O'Neill and David Afalla.

##SIFT detection
This project utilises libraries such as OpenCV, imshowtools, numpy and matplotlib to 
* implement Scale-invarient Feature transform feature matching based on two images of the same subject
    * FLANN based feature matching
* Essential matrix estimation (RANSAC Based)
    * Eight point algorithm and normalisation
* Compute and draw Epipoler lines
* Display disparity betwwen given images and compute a depth map of the subject
